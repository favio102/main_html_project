    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I completed my undergraduate degree in 2015 at the National University of San Andres, Bolivia, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering. In 2018, I earned a Master's degree from Yamagata University's Graduate School of Science and Engineering, with a focus on Management of Technology. My research thesis was highly evaluated by the academic professors, resulting in my being honored with an award for my work. This experience provided me with a deep understanding of the importance of hard work, dedication, and attention to detail in achieving my academic and professional goals.
